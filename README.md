# <p align="center"><ins>About Me</ins></p>
Welcome to my personal GitHub, my name is Justin or in online spaces I am known as Rabbischmitty/Rabbismitty. I am currently finishing my final course for my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Maryland Global Campus. Additionally, I recently earned my Security+, Linux+, and Splunk Core User Certification. I am also currently serving with 13 years in the United States Army as a Combat Medic and Licensed Practical Nurse. Last but not least, I am a husband and a father. My service with the Army is set to expire July 2025 and I am very excited to make a full transition from the realm of medicine and back to the realm of tech.

### Values and Beliefs:
1. Every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
2. The best way to reach resolution in conflict is with open and respectful conversation.
3. The best effort you can give is to be better than you were yesterday, perfection is not a realistic standard for anyone.
4. Expertise can only be achieved through diligence and discipline over a period of time.
5. People aren't perfect, it is better to be compassionate and understanding than to be vengeful.

# <p align="center"><ins>Why Tech?</ins></p>
My love for technology began in the early 90s on a TV that still had a dial playing the NES and Sega Genesis. It grew even more when we got our first home computer, it was a Packard Bell. I first started exploring the workings of the Windows operating system when I learned how to troubleshoot the conflicts in Device Manager after watching another episode of Call for Help with Leo Laporte. From there I continued to go deeper, participating in the Cisco Networking Academy in High School, and then beginning my studies in Computer Science and programming. It is a lifelong dream to obtain a career in tech exploring and learning a subject matter that has been pivotal in my life.

The tables below show some of the platforms and languages that I have worked with recently, and some languages that I am interested in learning or increasing my proficiency:

For my Capstone in Computer Science I was assigned to a group with the task of developing a Breakout style game in Python. Our team is going to be utilizing the Pygame and possibly Turle libraries for the game code. Additionally, we will be using GitHub for version control and CI/CD, and MS Teams to meet and manage other required assignments. We have determined to treat each week as a sprint, so we meet on Sundays to both wrap up our current sprint and kick off the next sprint. Our biggest identified hurdle, is that we are inexperienced with Pygame and Turtle so our team will need to learn these libraries in order to successfully complete this project and produce the required deliverable. To help mitigate issues that may come up in development, we have been compiling our references onto the GitHub wiki for our repo so that all team members can easily access them.
